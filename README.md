# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Intro:

In this semester project, I undertook the challenge of creating a dynamic and fully responsive auction website, showcasing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the course of five weeks, I navigated through the complexities of web development, utilizing REST APIs to fetch and manage data seamlessly. The primary goal was to provide users with a platform where they could list items for bidding, participate in auctions, and manage their credits. As users interacted with the site, I implemented JavaScript for enhanced functionality, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience. From user registration to credit management, this project not only honed my technical skills but also underscored the importance of testing and deploying a functional website. The result is an end-to-end solution that reflects my growth and competence in web technologies.

Login and register: 

In developing the registration and login functionality, my primary focus was on creating a seamless and secure user experience. For registration, I implemented form validation to ensure the correctness of user-provided information, such as a valid email format and a sufficiently strong password. The login process involves real-time validation of email and password, providing immediate feedback to users. To enhance security, I integrated token-based authentication, securely storing access tokens in local storage upon successful login. Additionally, I incorporated user-friendly messages for a clear understanding of registration and login outcomes. The modular structure ensures easy integration into the broader web application, paving the way for subsequent features reliant on authenticated user sessions. Overall, prioritizing usability, security, and integration simplicity was at the forefront of my decision-making process.

Navbar:

In constructing the Navbar, my goal was to create a dynamic and responsive user interface that adapts to the authentication status. Leveraging the AuthContext, I implemented features such as conditional rendering of login/logout options, user-specific information display, and a collapsible menu for authenticated users. Real-time updates of user credits and avatar, reflected in the Navbar, ensure a seamless and interactive experience. The AuthContext, functioning as a central hub for authentication-related state and actions, facilitates streamlined communication between components. The Navbar dynamically adjusts its content based on the user's login status, providing a personalized experience. Additionally, the use of local storage ensures persistence across page reloads, maintaining a consistent user experience. By prioritizing clarity, simplicity, and real-time updates, I aimed to create an intuitive and efficient Navbar that enhances user interaction within the auction website.

Homepage: 

In crafting the homepage, my objective was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the auction website. The hero banner sets the tone, inviting users to engage with the platform. Leveraging the FetchListings component, I seamlessly retrieve and display auction listings. The real-time countdown timers provide a dynamic touch, keeping users informed about listing deadlines. The search bar empowers users to quickly find relevant listings, enhancing overall usability. Implementing a "Load More" button optimizes content visibility, striking a balance between information density and a clean layout. The "Create Listing" button opens a modal, streamlining the listing creation process for users. Each listing, accompanied by key details, links to a dedicated page for a comprehensive view. The consistent application of styles ensures a cohesive visual identity throughout the homepage. Overall, I aimed for a well-organized and engaging homepage, prioritizing user experience by integrating essential features and maintaining a visually appealing design.

Listing items page:

The ListingItem page was crafted with a focus on delivering a rich and interactive experience for users engaging with specific auction listings. Through dynamic URL parameters, the page dynamically fetches the targeted listing, ensuring a smooth and personalized user journey. Users can seamlessly place bids using the intuitive "Place Bid" button, with bid details dynamically updating the highest bid and triggering API calls for real-time interactions. The CountdownTimer component adds a sense of urgency, displaying the time remaining until the listing concludes. The page displays crucial information, including seller details, the winning bid, and the time since the bid was placed. Responsive design ensures a consistent layout across various devices. Robust error handling enhances the user experience by gracefully managing scenarios like listing not found or API errors. The bid input interface is user-friendly, appearing dynamically when users opt to place a bid. API calls are optimized to fetch only essential data, contributing to improved performance. In essence, the ListingItem page aims to engage users effectively, encouraging bid participation and providing key details in an aesthetically pleasing and responsive format.

- Conclusion:

In conclusion, this semester project has been a comprehensive exploration of web development, where I successfully designed and implemented a dynamic and responsive auction website. Navigating the complexities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I integrated REST APIs for efficient data management and delivery. The project spans user registration, authentication, and credit management, showcasing my technical proficiency and a keen focus on user experience. The login and registration functionalities prioritize usability and security, incorporating real-time validation, token-based authentication, and clear user feedback. The Navbar adapts dynamically to user authentication status, offering personalized features and real-time updates. The homepage presents an engaging interface with visual appeal, combining features like dynamic listings, countdown timers, and a streamlined listing creation process through modals. The ListingItem page further enhances user engagement by providing a rich, interactive experience for specific auction listings, emphasizing real-time bid updates, responsive design, and robust error handling. Overall, this project represents my growth and competence in web technologies, encapsulating a user-centric approach, attention to detail, and a seamless integration of functionality and design. The website stands as a testament to the successful application of acquired skills and serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio.

Summary of Design Choices: In crafting the dynamic and responsive auction website, my design choices were driven by simplicity, user-centricity, and visual coherence. The color palette, drawn from a carefully selected scheme, aimed to evoke a sense of clarity and professionalism. The clean and straightforward layout prioritized usability, ensuring that users could seamlessly navigate through various functionalities. The choice of a modular structure facilitated easy integration and scalability, especially in features reliant on authenticated user sessions. Real-time updates in the Navbar, including user credits and avatar, enhanced the interactive experience, while local storage persistence maintained consistency across page reloads.
